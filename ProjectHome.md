**MTA Advanced Chat System** is a resource for Multi Theft Auto San Andreas 1.0.x, made with aim to provide advanced level of chat control.

Main goal, which defined this project was, and still is, to make chat easy for both English speaking and non-English speaking community by separating server-wide chat to several channels, which are visible only to players inside that channel. This also takes private messaging to the next level, by allowing more players to participate in a private chat.
